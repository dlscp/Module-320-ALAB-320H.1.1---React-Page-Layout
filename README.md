# Module-320-ALAB-320H.1.1---React-Page-Layout

Assignment is mostly complete. I used the useMemo hook for the search function, and also used onChange and onSubmit to make the search function work. To make things pretty I just used bootstrap styling for most of it will all the utilities classes. I did customize things in css just for placement and spacing. If I wanted to make it better I would add more spacing, fix the font of the header and make it so when you cleared the search bar the employee side reset to empty.
